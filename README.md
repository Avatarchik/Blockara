# Blockara
## wut
Blockara is a head-to-head action puzzle game where you, one of the best alchemists in the world, must compete in the World Alchemy Tournament for a chance to have your wish granted by the September Dragon! Fight your way to the top in Story Mode or hone your skills in the other game modes!

## why
It was inevitable that I would make a game that isn't just a smug pixelated flash game.
